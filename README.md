# Get Next Line

A C function that reads a text file line by line, using static variables to maintain state between function calls.

## üìã Project Overview

**get_next_line** reads one line at a time from a file descriptor, making it memory-efficient for large files. It uses a static buffer to persist data between calls, ensuring optimal performance.

## üîß Function Prototype

```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```

**Parameters:**

- `fd`: File descriptor to read from

**Return Value:**

- Line read (including `\n` if present)
- `NULL` when EOF is reached or on error

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Functions

- **`get_next_line(fd)`** - Main function that orchestrates the reading process
- **`ft_read_file(fd, res)`** - Reads from file descriptor until newline or EOF
- **`ft_line(buffer)`** - Extracts current line from buffer
- **`ft_next(buffer)`** - Updates buffer with remaining content
- **`ft_free(buffer, buf)`** - Helper for memory management

### Utility Functions ([get_next_line_utils.c](get_next_line_utils.c))

- `ft_strjoin()` - Concatenates two strings
- `ft_strchr()` - Locates character in string
- `ft_calloc()` - Allocates zero-initialized memory
- `ft_strlen()` - Calculates string length
- `ft_bzero()` - Sets memory to zero

## üß† Static Variables Explained

```c
static char *buffer;  // Persists between function calls
```

| Memory Section   | Purpose                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Stack**        | Local (automatic) variables                   |
| **Heap**         | Dynamically allocated memory (`malloc`)       |
| **Data Segment** | `global/static` variables with initial values |
| **Text**         | Program code                                  |

**Why Static?**

- Maintains state between function calls
- Avoids global variables (better encapsulation)
- Memory allocated once, persists until program ends

## üöÄ Compilation & Usage

```bash
# Compile with custom buffer size
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 *.c

# Test with provided main
./a.out
```

## üìä Algorithm Flow

```
1. Check if fd is valid
2. Read chunks of BUFFER_SIZE bytes
3. Store in static buffer until newline found
4. Extract one line from buffer
5. Update buffer with remaining content
6. Return the line (caller must free)
```

## üß™ Testing

The project includes a [main.c](main.c) that tests reading from [test.txt](test.txt) line by line, demonstrating the function's capability to handle various line lengths and content.

# Static Variables

| Memory Section   | Purpose                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Stack**        | Local (automatic) variables                   |
| **Heap**         | Dynamically allocated memory (`malloc`)       |
| **Data Segment** | `global/static` variables with initial values |
| **BSS Segment**  | `global/static` variables without init value  |
| **Text**         | Program code                                  |

## Where Does `static` Go?

- It‚Äôs stored in the **data segment** (because it has an initial value of 0).
- Because it‚Äôs `static`:  
   ‚Üí It is **allocated only once** in memory.  
   ‚Üí Every time the function is called, the same memory address is used.

```c
void my_function() {
    static int counter = 0;
    counter++;
    printf("%d\n", counter);
}
```

Every time you call `my_function()`, the `counter` at address `0x100` is updated ‚Äî but it is **never destroyed** until the program ends.

| Feature          | `int x = 0;` (non-static) | `static int x = 0;` |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Memory Location  | Stack                     | Data Segment        |
| Lifetime         | Until function ends       | Until program ends  |
| Remembers Value? | No                        | Yes                 |

- `static` in C allows you to:
  - Persist memory **without global scope**.
  - Avoid memory leaks by not needing `malloc/free`.

# read from a file

```c
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);
```

## return value
Upon successful completion, read() and pread() shall return a non-negative integer indicating the number of bytes actually read. Otherwise, the functions shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.
